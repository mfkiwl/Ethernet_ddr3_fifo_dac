2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks PHY_RXC and clk_out2_pll are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks PHY_RXC] -to [get_clocks clk_out2_pll]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out2_pll and PHY_RXC are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out2_pll] -to [get_clocks PHY_RXC]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks PHY_RXC and clk_out2_pll are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks PHY_RXC] -to [get_clocks clk_out2_pll]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out2_pll and PHY_RXC are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out2_pll] -to [get_clocks PHY_RXC]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT iprecieve_inst/fifo_dac_wr_clk_INST_0 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#2 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT ipsend_inst/eth_tx_dbg_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-1#1 Warning
Clock Net has non-BUF driver and too many loads  
Clock net ipsend_inst/eth_tx_dbg_i_1_n_0 is not driven by a Clock Buffer and has more than 512 loads. Driver(s): ipsend_inst/eth_tx_dbg/clk, ipsend_inst/eth_tx_dbg_i_1/O
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) PHY_MDIO direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (PHY_MDIO) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '8' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
